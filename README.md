# mRPI
solve mRPI via SOS
======================Toolboxes Required:=================================
1.spotless:
URL: https://github.com/spot-toolbox/spotless

Tips: A fork of the Systems Polynomial Optimization Toolbox. Polynomial computation in the FT is supported by this toolbox.

2.mosek:
URL: http://www.mosek.com

Tips: MOSEK is a highly efficient commercial solver of LPs, QPs, SOCPs, SDPs, and MIPs. This is a basic element of the following toolboxes for solving optimization problems. The toolbox "sedumi" also works well for SDPs but is too slower than mosek.
